# Democracy sucks


>"-What is democracy?

>-It got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe"

â€” Johnny got his gun (1971)


By democracy I don't mean "the people says what the State does" but
"The people elects the state"

To vote, you only have to survive, let's say, 18 years. In 18 years,
you could be an idiot or a genius. 

Most people are, sadly, idiots (NPCs). So they don't really know what they're
going when they go to a election. 

Most of these people watch television. So their opinion is highly
manipulated by the media. That implies that democracy is a way to make
us feel free. But we're doing what the media want us to do.

And in the best case, if people wasn't manipuled by the media. No
election can lead use to socialism. Because the rich wouldn't allow
that. And there aren't much working-class candidates.
