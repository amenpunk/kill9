# Uefi sucks

BIOS did one thing and did it well. Graphical CMOS setups aren't
necessary, and what the hell is secure boot?

If someone is smarter enough to boot something from the BIOS, that
person is smarter enough not to install malicious software on the boot
devices. So secure boot isn't necessary.

Why do we need a efi boot partition?
