# Java sucks

>“Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California.” 

--- Edsger Dijkstra



**Java is write once, run away.**

Java is the new COBOL.

Java is object oriented. So that make it suck automatically.

## Bloated syntax

~~~
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
~~~

I'm sure the "public class" and "public static void" aren't really necessary. That just makes the code more confusing

```System.out.println```? Jesus that's stupid

## Virtual machine

Sooo. You have to run a virtual machine to run any program made in Java. Why?

The programmer was too lazy to port the software to other operating system. So what they did is the following:

1. Download the Java Development Kit
2. Download the Java Runtime Environment
3. Download an IDE (This is perfectly okay though)
4. Compile the program to the Java Virtual Machine shit
5. Run a virtual machine to run a Hello World program
6. Make everyone run a virtual machine to run that program.

## Alternatives to Java

* C
* Perl (Perl DON'T HAVE TO be Object Oriented. Actually perl is anything you want)
* Any Lisp programming language
* Anything that isn't Object-Oriented
* Jumping onto the eye of the hurricane

# ABOLISH THE CLASS SYSTEM
