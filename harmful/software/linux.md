# Linux sucks

\>1990  
\>Monolithic kernel 

A monolithic kernel in 1990 is stupid. That just makes the shit go
back to 1970. 

## Linux is bloated as fuck

\>+15 million lines of code

Even systemd is less bloated.

Do you have an Intel wifi card? No? I don't care, here's the driver.

```ls /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/intel```



I do not need that driver, yet I still have it, and I didn't want to
install it. 

Did you install GNU/Linux on a Macbook? Well, here's thinkpad_acpi!

```/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.ko.gz```

Linux by default installs ***ALL*** the drivers. Which
sucks. It should only install the needed drivers.

### Linux sucks. But less

Linux is shitty, but it is our livesafer. So isn't truly harmful. But I
put it in harmful because it would be stupid to create another section
just for Linux
