# Python is the worst programming language used nowadays

# Lacks everything

* No pointers.
* No ternary operators (no, ifes in one line are not ternary operators)
* No switch (if else if else if else if else if else if...)
* No constants
* It is a true miracle that Python has lambdas. (BTW you cannot give statements to a lambda. Which makes them very useless.)

# Other stuff
