# Online classes are literally Hitler

Because pandemics, we had to start making online classes.

Who the fuck thought that giving classes through internet would be a
good idea?

Teachers just send homework and barely classes. (Not to say that much
people can't have access to the online lessons).  Reciving 15 mostly
useless emails a day stresses me a lot because I don't know what I
should do with it

## Cyberexams are stupid

Some schools are trying to make the cyber classroom to be a real
classroom:

(What's the issue with copying on exams if you aren't learning
anything?)

I don't like the idea of a school depending on another corporation to
do their exams. You're giving the students' data to the corporation
which cannot be forgiven.

Some schools are even making students to put webcams on the online
classes and exams (which is not good, students may have self esteem
issues, Or just don't want to have a webcam in front of them). Could
be privacy passed if they used software like Jitsi. But they use, for
example z\*om, g\*\*gle meet, and stuff like that.

Avoiding it would be easy. Just say you don't have a webcam and you
don't have money for one. Problem solved. But probably some schools
wouldn't let you start the exam for that reason.
