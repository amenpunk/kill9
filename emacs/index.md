# Kill-9's Emacs things

Emacs (short for Editor MACroS) is a text editor[^1] made by some
weird guy in the late 70s, and had too many implementations, such as
Xemacs, Freemacs, µEmacs (microemacs). in 1984 (lmao), the GNU project ~~stole~~
rewrote the original Emacs code and the most used version of Emacs was
born: GNU Emacs.

# Installation

Windows users: <https://ftp.rediris.es/mirror/GNU/emacs/windows/> (Or their nearly GNU mirror)

Mac Users: brew install emacs, I guess.

GNU/Linux users: probably the "emacs" package on your distro's repos

BSD users: pkg install emacs, probably? or check /usr/ports

Plan 9 users: What are you doing here?

# Other versions of Emacs

As mencioned above, there are other versions of emacs, most of them
are obsolete (Xemacs for example).  µEmacs is the emacs version used
by Linus Torvalds[^2] I do not recommend to use it. If you want to use
a mini Emacs, you should try [Zile](https://gnu.org/software/zile) or
[Jed](http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/). Zile is stupidly minimum while Jed
has syntax highlighting and other kind of programs. But not close to
real GNU Emacs.

You can find more about Emacs on the sidebar.
