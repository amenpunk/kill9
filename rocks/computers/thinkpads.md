Old thinkpads are so easy to modify (unscrew one thing and you can get
to the storage device).
The keyboard is awesome, it has a cool and productive layout. And an
awesome keyfeel.

If you have one of the supported models, you can even
[change](https://libreboot.org) the BIOS, to a better initialization
software.

Lenovo killed thinkpads, they put this **HORRIBLE** keyboard layout
(it also looks horrible)

Plus the trackpad buttons sucks.

### Trackpoint

If you don't use the trackpoint. You have to use it right now. It will
make you very productive. You don't have to move your hands to the
mouse/trackpad to move the cursor. There are
[keyboards](https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/category/EnduraPro) with
trackpoints.

The only bad thing about thinkpads is the BIOS PCI cards
whitelist. Which can be bypassed with a BIOS mod or replacing the BIOS.
